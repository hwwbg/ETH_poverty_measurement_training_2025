# Poverty measturement training 
Hyatt Regency, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Aug. 25 to Aug. 29
## Introduction
This course's objective is to train colleagues from ESS and MoPD, familiarize them with the process of constructing welfare aggregates, and prepare them for the upcoming NISH 2024 survey. Using data from Ethiopia’s 2021 Household Survey (ETH2021), participants will gain hands-on experience in building a complete consumption aggregate and conducting poverty analysis in Stata.

The main reference for the course will be Giulia Mancini and Giovanni Vecchi’s paper “On the Construction of a Consumption Aggregate for Inequality and Poverty Analysis.” Most of the material will be drawn from this paper, complemented by additional topics such as robust approaches to aggregate construction and the derivation of a national poverty line. At times, the course will introduce methods that differ slightly from Mancini and Vecchi’s framework—sometimes because alternative approaches are more practical in the Ethiopian context, and sometimes to encourage critical reflection and discussion
