# Poverty measturement training 
Hyatt Regency, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
Aug. 25 to Aug. 29
## Introduction
The goal of the course is to prepare participants to construct welfare and poverty measures in Stata, following the latest recommendations.  Over the course, participants will construct a full consumption aggregate and poverty analysis using data from the Malawi 5th Integrated Household Survey.

The “textbook” for this class will be Giulia Mancini and Giovanni Vecchi’s paper “On the Construction of a Consumption Aggregate for Inequality and Poverty Analysis.”  This class will most of the material from the paper, as well as some additional topics such as robust construction and the construction of a national poverty line.  The class will often deliberately present a slightly different approach to the topics than M&V, sometimes because I find a different approach more helpful, and sometimes just for the sake of variety.
